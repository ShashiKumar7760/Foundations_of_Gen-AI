Imagine you want to ask for a juicy burger, but you phrase it as \"Give me a huge salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of fries.\" The restaurant might give you what you asked for, but it's not what you wanted. A prompt engineer would craft a prompt like \"I'd like a classic cheeseburger, medium-rare, with fries on the side\" to get the desired outcome.\n",
